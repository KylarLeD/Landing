# freeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains my freeCodeCamp workshops, labs, and certification projects.  

These projects are part of my learning journey and focus on practical coding skills, problem-solving, and understanding how different programming concepts work in practice.  

For each project, I include:
- Notes on what I learned
- Comments in the code to demonstrate understanding
