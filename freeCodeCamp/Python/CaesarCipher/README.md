# Caesar Cipher Project

## Overview
This project is from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**FreeCodeCamp**</a>. I created a simple **Caesar cipher** program in Python to explore basic encryption and learn some useful Python tools.  

A Caesar cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques: it shifts each letter in a message by a set number of places in the alphabet.

## What I Learned

1. **How the Caesar Cipher Works**  
The Caesar cipher replaces each letter with another letter a fixed distance away. It’s reversible, so encrypted messages can be decrypted by shifting letters in the opposite direction. This helped me understand the basics of encryption and decryption.

2. **Translation Tables with `str.maketrans()`**  
I learned how to use translation tables to map letters to their shifted counterparts. This makes converting a full string simple and efficient using Python’s built-in string methods.

3. **String Slicing**  
I practiced slicing strings to rotate the alphabet for the shift. This taught me how to manipulate strings in Python and use slicing creatively.

4. **Checking Variable Types with `isinstance()`**  
I learned how to check the data type of variables to make sure they’re valid before using them. This is a useful practice to prevent errors and make programs more robust.
